CloudCrew Hub is a cloud-native, community-driven platform designed to support AWS re/Start graduates and cloud learners. It acts as a digital launchpad where users can document their journey, showcase projects, connect with peers, and access personalized resources powered by AWS services.

The Problem:
Many AWS re/Start graduates struggle to maintain momentum after completing the program. Without continued guidance, networking, or practical cloud projects, their skills fade or go underutilized-making job readiness difficult.

The Solution – CloudCrew Hub

Personal Profiles: Users showcase AWS badges, certifications, portfolio projects, and goals.
Peer Networking: Connect with other learners, share advice, and get feedback.
Project Gallery: A space to publish cloud projects with architecture diagrams, AWS services used, and lessons learned.
Real-Time Chat & Forums: Ask questions, get support, and share tips in real-time.
Curated Resources & Job Prep Tools: Articles, labs, and guides tailored to each learner’s journey.
Progress Tracker: Visual dashboard of completed projects, milestones, and certifications.


Tech Stack (AWS Focus):
         
         Front-End: AWS Amplify + React for seamless UI
Backend & APIs: AWS AppSync (GraphQL) for real-time features and data syncing
Database: Amazon DynamoDB for user and project data
Auth & Security: Amazon Cognito for secure user sign-up/login
